# Maintenance and 0.3.1 progress

Updated: 2026-09-24. Lantern DSSE is actively maintained by Lantern Networks, Inc.
The latest published version is [0.3.0 experimental](https://github.com/lantern-networks/dsse-core/releases/tag/v0.3.0-experimental), released on September 11.
**0.3.1 is in development and has not been released.**

The target is the week of September 28–October 4, 2026, subject to the release checks
below. This is a planning target, not an availability commitment. If it moves, this
page will record the remaining blockers and revised outlook.

## What is being maintained

The current priority is reliability in everyday administration: creating, editing,
removing and enabling records; preserving saved settings; enforcing permissions;
propagating changes; and recording audit events. New features are outside the
0.3.1 stabilization scope.

These changes have been implemented and checked on the
[development PR](https://github.com/lantern-networks/dsse-core/pull/1).
They are **not included in the published 0.3.0 release**:

| Area | Change | Evidence available so far |
|---|---|---|
| People | Retrieve the full directory for search; protect existing synchronized records during manual creation | Local browser operations, saved-state and audit comparisons, regression tests; PostgreSQL checked separately for creation protection |
| Directory updates | Preserve user-risk association after subject or email changes | Local browser risk changes, import and decision API checks, saved-state and audit comparisons; separate PostgreSQL regression |
| DLP and access rules | Preserve existing settings and references during ordinary edits; restore permitted read-only DLP listing | Local browser checks, saved-state and audit comparisons, automated regressions |
| Applications | Keep an existing published application destination’s display name in sync after ordinary edits; preserve destination identity and group references | Local browser edits, saved-state and audit comparisons; permission and partial-save regressions |
| Organizations | Preserve delegation choices and other stored fields during ordinary name edits | Local browser permission checks, saved-state and audit comparisons, automated regressions |
| Administrator onboarding and traffic overview | Check activation/login and period-based display of nonzero traffic data | Local browser and stored-data comparisons |

Local browser checks and separate database tests do not establish independent
control-plane/Edge operation, external identity-provider interoperability, or
long-duration reliability. Test counts are not a release-readiness percentage.

## What still blocks 0.3.1

- Finish outstanding everyday-operation checks and fix reproduced defects with
  material effects on access, saved data or audit records. The published-application
  name synchronization defect has been corrected on the development branch.
  The next evidence review covers administrator invitation, activation and login;
  already verified shared flows will not be repeated.
- Resolve or explicitly assess remaining persistence and restart limitations;
  postponing an investigation does not turn it into a passed check.
- Install from the public instructions and verify real allowed and denied traffic,
  control-plane/Edge propagation, regional failure, PKI rotation and sustained
  operation in the planned three-region, one-node-per-region deployment.
- Complete the applicable release checks, signed-artifact verification and
  release notes, including known limitations and upgrade guidance.

The latest release remains experimental. Merging a fix does not certify production
readiness or make an unreleased build a supported release.

## How changes reach users

We will integrate focused, independently reviewable fixes as they meet their own
review and verification requirements. A documentation change or a verified isolated
fix need not wait for every deployment test for the next release. The accumulated
development PR remains visible while its dependencies and integration path are
reviewed; it is not approval to merge the entire batch at once.

Each fix should describe the user-visible problem, the resulting behavior, relevant
checks and remaining limits. Related changes may be grouped when they must ship
together. The [contribution guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md#integration-and-release-checks)
explains the distinction between integration and release checks.

This page will be updated when a meaningful fix is integrated, the next blocker
changes, or the target week changes. Published versions and delivered fixes are
recorded in [Releases](https://github.com/lantern-networks/dsse-core/releases).
Report ordinary reproducible bugs through [Issues](https://github.com/lantern-networks/dsse-core/issues);
report vulnerabilities privately according to the [security policy](../SECURITY.md).
